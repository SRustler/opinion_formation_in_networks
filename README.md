## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

We want to study the mechanisms of opinion formation in a network of people. In addition, we also allow the network itself to be adaptable to the opinions existing on it, making two interdependent forces of network evolution and opinion formation measurable.

The motivation for this project involves two different angles on very fundamental dynamics of our society. First of all, we would like to understand the ways in which humans become who they are under the influence of their environment. How do people form their opinions, values, and beliefs and how do their friends and acquaintances play a role in this? Secondly, we are interested in the way our networks of friends and social ties form in the first place. How and why do we choose to be friends with certain people and not with others? How do networks of people in a society form? 

From an intuitive point of view (considering that we are all social beings) most people would argue that the two aspects are interdependent or even that they are two extremes of the same process: Our social environment certainly shapes what we believe and which opinions we hold, while in turn our own values and opinions influence whom we choose to connect with and make part of our social network. On the basis of this rather vague but plausible assumption, our project is an attempt to disentangle and study the effects of these two mechanisms on each other by the means of an abstract, quantitative model. 

An example of a system that one would expect to be subject to such behavior and that we would like to put a focus on is religious affiliation within a society. It could be argued that the social surroundings have an effect on (or, as an extreme, completely determine) which religion a person chooses to belong to. Also, one's religion also influences to whom we connect with socially, for example through the community in a church (the opposing extreme would be that a person's social ties are entirely composed of member's of the same religion).

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

Does the social network shape peoples's opinions or do opinions shape the structure of the network?

How can we classify opinion and network structures based on these competing tendencies?

Specific example: How does the distribution of religious affiliation and size of religious groups change in dependence of the "mixture" of these competing forces?

Optional (if data and time available): Do the modeled results fit real distributions of religions in specific countries? Based on this, can we make inferences about the mechanisms of opinion and network formation in different countries?



(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

The proposed model is of course not constructed from scratch, but based on the one described in [1]. In said publication, the authors describe a critical behavior of the group size and group distribution that is analogous to a 2nd order phase transition known from physics: As the probability $\Phi$ (describing a continuous "mixture" of the two processes of network and opinion formation) is varied, the clusters of opinions develop into two distinct types ("phases"). Above a critical value of $\Phi$, the number and size of groups is more or less randomly distributed. Below a critical value, the behavior is radically different and one large group dominates over a few small groups. 

For our model, we would expect to reproduce this behavior.
