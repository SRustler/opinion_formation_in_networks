% Generating graph
A_sp = random_graph(N, p_connect);  %Generate random graph
A_adj = full(A_sp);                 %Same graph as an adjacency 
k_avg = 2*sum(sum(A_adj))/N;        %Compute avg degree to compare with set



%Generating opinion vector
%Nx1 vector filled with rand ints from 1 to G with replacement=true
g = randsample(G,N,true);

%Run simulation
