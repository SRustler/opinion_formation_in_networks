k_set = 4;          %expected/wanted average degree
gamma = 10;     %expected gamma
N = 500; %number of nodes

% Calculate other parameters based on this
M = k_exp*N/2;      %number of edges
G = N/gamma;    %number of opinions


p_connect = (M)/(N*(N-1)); % --> probability of connection given by lecture notes:


% Generating graph
A_sp = random_graph(N, p_connect);  %Generate random graph
A_adj = full(A_sp);                 %Same graph as an adjacency 
k_avg = 2*sum(sum(A_adj))/N;        %Compute avg degree, analytically given by: 2M/N
